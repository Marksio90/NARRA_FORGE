**Techniques to Use**:

**Examples to Emulate**: {genre_style['examples']}

## CRITICAL WRITING PRINCIPLES

### 1. SHOW DON'T TELL
❌ BAD: "She was angry."
✅ GOOD: "Her jaw clenched. The mug shattered against the wall."

Use:
- Body language (clenched fists, racing heart, trembling)
- Dialogue subtext (what's NOT said)
- Actions revealing emotions
- Sensory details showing mood

### 2. DEEP POV (We're IN {pov_character['name']}'s head!)
- Filter everything through {pov_character['name']}'s perspective
- Use their vocabulary, their metaphors, their biases
- No "saw/heard/felt" filters - we ARE them
- Internal thoughts in their voice
- Emotional reactions to everything

❌ Filtering: "She saw the door open."
✅ Deep POV: "The door creaked. Her breath caught."

### 3. FIVE SENSES (Immersion!)
Every scene needs:
- **Sight**: What they see (most common)
- **Sound**: Dialogue, ambient noise, silence
- **Touch**: Temperature, texture, physical sensation
- **Smell**: Powerful for emotion and memory
- **Taste**: When relevant

Don't info-dump - sprinkle throughout.

### 4. MRU SEQUENCES (Motivation-Reaction Units)
Scene structure:
1. **Motivation** (External stimulus): Something happens
2. **Reaction** (Internal response): Character feels/thinks
3. **Action** (External response): Character does something

This creates natural cause-and-effect flow.

### 5. PACING CONTROL

**Fast Pacing** (action, tension):
- Short sentences. Fragments.
- Short paragraphs.
- Active verbs.
- Limited description.

**Slow Pacing** (emotion, description):
- Longer, flowing sentences with clauses and connections.
- Detailed sensory immersion.
- Internal reflection.
- Rich metaphors.

Vary your rhythm!

### 6. DIALOGUE INTEGRATION

- Dialogue reveals character (voice, education, mood)
- Avoid "talking heads" - add action beats
- Use subtext (what's NOT said)
- Vary speech patterns per character
- No info dumps in dialogue

Example:
```
"I'm fine." She turned away, shoulders tight.
He reached for her arm. "That's not what I—"
"I said I'm fine." The words came out sharper than intended.
```

### 7. AVOID COMMON MISTAKES

❌ Purple prose (overwrit

ten, flowery language)
❌ Info dumps (world-building as lectures)
❌ Telling emotions ("She felt sad")
❌ Adverb abuse ("he said angrily" - show it!)
❌ Passive voice (unless intentional)
❌ Filter words (saw, heard, felt, knew, wondered)
❌ Head-hopping (stay in ONE POV)

## YOUR TASK

Write the COMPLETE chapter content ({target_word_count} words).

**Structure**:
1. **Opening Hook** (grab attention immediately)
2. **Scene Development** (show the events of this chapter)
3. **Character Growth** (internal change, realization, or deepening conflict)
4. **Cliffhanger/Transition** (make them want to keep reading)

**Requirements**:
- Stay in {pov_character['name']}'s POV the ENTIRE time
- Use their voice consistently
- Reach {target_word_count} words (don't cut short!)
- Include dialogue where appropriate
- Balance action with interiority
- Advance the plot while developing character
- Employ {genre} genre conventions
- Make it ENGAGING and UNPUTDOWNABLE

Write the chapter now. Begin with the chapter title and dive in.
